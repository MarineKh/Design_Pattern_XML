			<h3 id="list1">Early life and education</h3>
			<p><span class="tab">Wales</span> was born in 
			<a title="Huntsville,Alabama" href="&wiki;Huntsville,_Alabama">Huntsville, Alabama,</a>
			shortly before midnight on August 7, 1966; however, his birth certificate lists his date of birth as the 8th.His father, Jimmy, worked as a grocery store manager, while his mother, Doris Ann (née Dudley), and his grandmother, Erma, ran the House of Learning,[14][15] a small private school in the tradition of the 
			<a title="One room school" href="&wiki;One-room_school">one-room schoolhouse,</a>
			where Wales and his three siblings received their early education</p>
			<p><span class="tab">As</span> a child, Wales was a keen reader with an acute intellectual curiosity.[6] When he was three, his mother bought a 
			<a title="World Book Encyclopedia" href="&wiki;World_Book_Encyclopedia">World Book Encyclopedia</a> from a door-to-door salesman. As he grew up and learned to read, it became an object of reverence. It put at his fingertips an abundant supply of knowledge complete with maps, illustrations, and a few cellophane layers of transparencies one could lift to explore such things as the muscles, arteries, and digestive system of a dissected frog. But Wales soon discovered that the World Book had shortcomings: no matter how much was in it, there were many more things that weren't. World Book sent out stickers for owners to paste on the pages in order to update the encyclopedia, and Wales was careful to put the stickers to work. "I joke that I started as a kid revising the encyclopedia by stickering the one my mother bought."</p>

			<h3 id="list2">Wikipedia</h3>
			<p><span class="tab">Originally,</span> Bomis planned to make Wikipedia a profitable business.Sanger initially saw Wikipedia primarily as a tool to aid Nupedia development. Wales feared that at worst, it might produce "complete rubbish". To the surprise of Sanger and Wales, within a few days of launching the number of articles on Wikipedia had outgrown that of Nupedia, and a small collective of editors had formed.It was Jimmy Wales, along with other people, who came up with the broader idea of an open-source, collaborative encyclopedia that would accept contributions from ordinary people. Initially, neither Sanger nor Wales knew what to expect from the Wikipedia initiative.Many of the early contributors to the site were familiar with the model of the 
			<a title="Free culture movement" href="&wiki;Free_culture_movement">free culture movement,</a>
			and, like Wales, many of them sympathized with the 
			<a title="Open-source movement" href="&wiki;Open-source_movement">open-source movement.</a>
			Wales has said that he was initially so worried about the concept of open editing, where anyone can edit the encyclopedia, that he would awake during the night and monitor what was being added. Nonetheless, the cadre of early editors helped create a robust, self-regulating community that has proven conducive to the growth of the project.In a talk at SXSW in 2016, he recalled that he wrote the first words on Wikipedia: "Hello world", a phrase computer programmers often use to test new software.</p>
			<p><span class="tab">Sanger</span> developed Wikipedia in its early phase and guided the project. The broader idea he originally ascribes to other people, remarking in a 2005 memoir for Slashdot that "the idea of an open source, collaborative encyclopedia, open to contribution by ordinary people, was entirely Jimmy's, not mine, and the funding was entirely by Bomis. Of course, other people had had the idea", adding, "the actual development of this encyclopedia was the task he gave me to work on." Sanger worked on and promoted both the Nupedia and Wikipedia projects until Bomis discontinued funding for his position in February 2002; Sanger resigned as editor-in-chief of Nupedia and as "chief organizer" of Wikipedia on March 1 of that year. Early on, Bomis supplied the financial backing for Wikipedia,[43][48] and entertained the notion of placing advertisements on Wikipedia before costs were reduced with Sanger's departure and plans for a nonprofit foundation were advanced instead.</p>

			<h3 id="list3">Wikimedia Foundation</h3>
			<img class="wiki" src="wikipedia.jpg"/>
			<p><span class="tab">In</span> mid-2003, Wales set up the 
			<a title="Wikimedia Foundation" href="&wiki;Wikimedia_Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation (WMF),</a>
			a non-profit organization founded in 
			<a title="San Francisco, Florida" href="&wiki;St._Petersburg,_Florida">St. Petersburg, Florida</a>
			and later headquartered in 
			<a title="San Francisco, California" href="&wiki;St._Petersburg,California">San Francisco, California.</a>
			All intellectual property rights and domain names pertaining to Wikipedia were moved to the new foundation, whose purpose is to establish general policy for the encyclopedia and its sister projects. Wales has been a member of the Wikimedia Foundation's Board of Trustees since it was formed and was its official chairman from 2003 through 2006. Since 2006 he has been accorded the honorary title of chairman emeritus and holds the board-appointed "community founder" seat. His work for the foundation, including his appearances to promote it at computer and educational conferences, has always been unpaid.Wales has often joked that donating Wikipedia to the foundation was both the "dumbest and the smartest" thing he had done. On one hand, he estimated that Wikipedia was worth US$3 billion; on the other, he weighed his belief that the donation made its success possible.</p>
			<p><span class="tab">Wales's</span> association with the foundation has led to controversy. In March 2008, Wales was accused by former Wikimedia Foundation employee Danny Wool of misusing the foundation's funds for recreational purposes. Wool also stated that Wales had his Wikimedia credit card taken away in part because of his spending habits, a claim Wales denied. Then-chairperson of the foundation Florence Devouard and former foundation interim Executive Director Brad Patrick denied any wrongdoing by Wales or the foundation, saying that Wales accounted for every expense and that, for items for which he lacked receipts, he paid out of his own pocket; in private, Devouard upbraided Wales for "constantly trying to rewrite the past". Later in March 2008, it was claimed by Jeffrey Vernon Merkey that Wales had edited Merkey's Wikipedia entry to make it more favorable in return for donations to the Wikimedia Foundation, an allegation Wales dismissed as "nonsense".In early 2016 Wikipedia editors perceived the WMF's Knowledge Engine project as a conflict of interest for Wales, whose business Wikia might benefit from having the WMF spend a lot of money on research in respect to search. Wikia attempted to develop a search engine but it was closed in 2009.</p>

			<img class="wife" src="wife.jpg"/>
			<p><span class="tab">Jimmy</span> Wales has been married three times. At the age of twenty, he married Pamela Green, a co-worker at a grocery store in Alabama. They divorced in 1993. He met his second wife, Christine Rohan, through a friend in Chicago while she was working as a steel trader for 
			<a title="Mitsubishi" href="&wiki;Mitsubishi">Mitsubishi.</a> The couple were married in 
			<a title="Monroe County, Florida" href="&wiki;Monroe_County,_Florida">Monroe County, Florida</a>

			<p><span class="tab">Wales</span> had a brief relationship with Canadian conservative columnist 
			<a title="Rachel Marsden" href="&wiki;Rachel_Marsden">Rachel Marsden</a>

			Wales stated that there had been a relationship but that it was over and said that it had not influenced any matters on Wikipedia, a claim which was disputed by Marsden.</p>
